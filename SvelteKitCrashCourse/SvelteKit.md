# SvelteKit Crash Course

---

**SvelteKit gives us a chance to work all across the stack, front and back, inside a single project. For most modern we page you don't want to serve a static front-end page, you want to integrate some APIs, you might want to integrate database or other external-services like stripe. All of this is made pretty easy by Svelte and SvelteKit**

**And we don't have actually do anything else to get SvelteKit working, since now SvelteKit ships together with Svelte.**
